# SFRPGCharacterBuilder
This project was created to create a Kivy based character generator for the SFRPG.  I am currently working on getting it to a state where I'll be able to release under both Android and Windows.

In it's current state it builds in both environments, but does not have enough features to warrant releasing.  Currently finished:
  - Feats
  - Abilities for the following classes:
    - Soldier
    - Envoy
    - Operative
  - Skills
  - Basic stats
  - PDF Character Sheet Generation

What needs to get done before releasing v1.0
  - All other classes need to be imported
  - Weapons and other equipment
  - Spells
  - Companions (AKA Mechanic)
  
I'm sure there are currently many bugs in the features that do exist.  The effort right now is to get basic functionality and polish afterwards.
